A sense of profound sadness pervades the space. Before you lies the Entrance, a massive, crumbling doorway.\n\nYou cautiously move forward, your boots crunching on loose gravel.  A faint inscription is etched above a shattered pillar: 'Where shadows dance, the path unfolds.'  To the east, a dark corridor beckons. To the west, a partially collapsed chamber offers a glimpse of a dried-up statue.  A small, tarnished metal token lies on the floor.\n",
